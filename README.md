Project: Telegram Adder
Objective:
    Develop a modular tool for managing Telegram accounts.
    Transfer members between groups with multi-account support.
    Implement daily limits, error handling, and logging.
Language:
    Python
Code Format:
    Pure code without comments or explanations unless explicitly requested.
Communication:
    Write code in English.
    Direct communication with me in Persian.
General Guidelines:
    Follow the project structure provided in the documentation.
    Implement modules step-by-step as I request.
    Use Fernet encryption (AES-128-CBC with HMAC-SHA256) for sensitive data.
    Validate all inputs and configurations strictly.
    Ensure dynamic updates to settings during runtime.
    Handle errors with descriptive messages and categorize exceptions.
    Log all operations with sufficient context (timestamps, error codes, stack traces).
    Optimize performance using caching and avoid redundant computations.
    Encrypt sensitive data like API keys and passwords.
    Implement fallback mechanisms for critical operations (e.g., retry logic, alternative accounts).
    Provide clear user feedback in UI-related modules.
    Avoid hardcoding values; use constants or configuration files.
    Ensure cross-module consistency in naming conventions and coding styles.
    Minimize external dependencies and document them in requirements.txt.
    Add monitoring capabilities for performance metrics and error tracking.
Testing:
    All tests must show results briefly at the end for each error.
    Do not generate test modules unless explicitly requested.
    Implementation Notes:
    Break down complex methods into smaller reusable components.
    Preserve exception types for specific error handling in tests.
    Use Singleton pattern where applicable (e.g., for configuration management).
    Use pure code without comments for coding.
    If changes are needed in the code, only correct the necessary parts in the artifact and avoid rewriting the entire code.
    Wait for explicit requests to proceed to the next module or section.
    Avoid unnecessary English responses unless I request it.
    Ensure that modifications in one module during inter-module testing do not disrupt the isolated unit tests of other modules, preserving the integrity of individual module tests.

Directive for the AI to Understand My Instructions:

When I’m giving instructions, it’s important for you to recognize that I’m the one guiding the process. Here’s how you should interpret my directions:

Step-by-Step Progression:
When I start working on a section of the project, I expect you to break it down into smaller subsections and focus only on one subsection at a time. Do not move on to the next part until I explicitly ask you to.
Explanation Before Action:
For each subsection, provide detailed explanations in English about what it does or how it works. However, do not write any code unless I specifically instruct you to do so. Until then, your role is to explain and clarify.
Language Standards:
All technical descriptions, code comments, and documentation must be in English. Communication with me, including instructions, clarifications, and initial responses, MUST remain in Persian. Do not switch to English at the beginning of our conversation unless I explicitly ask for it.
Wait for Explicit Requests:
If a module or section has multiple parts (e.g., constants, functions, classes), explain the overall purpose first, then proceed to explain each part one by one. Only move forward when I explicitly ask you to continue or request code implementation.
Avoid Unnecessary English Responses:
At the start of our conversation, ensure all responses are in Persian unless I specify otherwise. This avoids confusion and ensures clarity in communication.
By following these guidelines, you’ll ensure that the workflow aligns with my expectations and the project progresses in an organized manner.


General Improvement Suggestions for All Modules:

Validation Enhancements:
Add stricter validation mechanisms to ensure all inputs and configurations are within acceptable ranges.
Validate data types, required fields, and logical constraints (e.g., non-negative delays, valid file paths).
Dynamic Updates:
Implement support for dynamic updates to configurations or settings during runtime without requiring a restart.
Provide APIs or interfaces for modifying settings in real-time.
Error Handling and Logging:
Improve error handling by adding more descriptive error messages and categorizing exceptions.
Ensure all errors are logged with sufficient context (e.g., timestamps, error codes, and stack traces).
Scalability:
Design modules to be scalable so that new features can be added without affecting existing functionality.
Use modular patterns like Factory or Strategy to allow extensibility.
Reusability:
Ensure each module is self-contained and reusable across different parts of the project or even in other projects.
Avoid hardcoding values and use constants or configuration files instead.
Test Coverage:
Increase test coverage to include edge cases, invalid inputs, and stress testing.
Add unit tests for all public methods and integration tests for interactions between modules.
Documentation:
Provide detailed inline comments and docstrings for all classes, methods, and functions.
Include usage examples and explanations for each module in the documentation.
Performance Optimization:
Optimize resource usage (e.g., memory, CPU) by reducing redundant computations or improving algorithms.
Use caching mechanisms where applicable to avoid repeated operations.
Security Enhancements:
Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., API keys, passwords) stored in configuration files or databases.
Add permission checks for file operations and API endpoints.
Fallback Mechanisms:
Implement fallback strategies for critical operations (e.g., retry logic, alternative accounts, or proxies).
Save state information to allow recovery in case of failures.
User Interface Improvements:
For UI-related modules, ensure the interface is intuitive and provides clear feedback to users.
Add progress indicators and error notifications for long-running operations.
Cross-Module Consistency:
Ensure consistent naming conventions, coding styles, and documentation formats across all modules.
Use a shared utility module for common functions (e.g., logging, validation) to avoid duplication.
Dependency Management:
Minimize external dependencies and ensure compatibility with the latest versions of libraries.
Document all dependencies and their purposes in the requirements.txt file.
Monitoring and Analytics:
Add monitoring capabilities to track performance metrics, success rates, and error frequencies.
Use analytics to identify bottlenecks or areas for improvement.
Localization Support:
If applicable, add support for multiple languages to make the project accessible to a wider audience.
Use language files or constants for text strings instead of hardcoding them.
Code Simplification:
Refactor complex methods or classes to improve readability and maintainability.
Break down large functions into smaller, reusable components.
File and Data Management:
Ensure proper handling of file paths (absolute vs. relative) and existence checks.
Add backup mechanisms for critical data files to prevent data loss.
Concurrency and Parallelism:
Optimize multi-threading or asynchronous operations to improve performance.
Handle race conditions and ensure thread safety where applicable.
Version Control and Updates:
Maintain version history for each module to track changes and improvements.
Provide migration scripts or guidelines for updating to newer versions.

## Troubleshooting Test Execution Errors in Encryption Module

### Common Error Pattern

When implementing modules that can raise multiple types of exceptions, be careful with exception handling in your methods. A common error occurs when base methods wrap specific exceptions inside more generic ones, which causes tests to fail if they're explicitly checking for specific exception types.

### Error Example

In the `encryption.py` module, we encountered two specific test failures:

1. In `test_load_salt_invalid_length`: The test expected an `EncryptionError` when loading a salt with insufficient length, but received a `FileReadError` instead.

2. In `test_load_key_invalid_length`: The test expected an `EncryptionError` for an invalid key length, but received a `FileReadError` instead.

### Root Cause

The issue was in the exception handling within the implementation:

```python
# Problematic implementation
try:
    # Code that raises EncryptionError for validation issues
    if len(salt) < 8:
        raise EncryptionError("Salt is too short")
except Exception as e:  # This catches ALL exceptions including EncryptionError
    # And converts them to FileReadError
    raise FileReadError(path, str(e))
```

This pattern catches and rewraps all exceptions, including our custom validation exceptions, which breaks the ability to test for specific error types.

### Solution

Add specific exception handling for exceptions that should be propagated directly:

```python
# Correct implementation
try:
    # Code that raises EncryptionError for validation issues
    if len(salt) < 8:
        raise EncryptionError("Salt is too short")
except FileNotFoundError:
    # Handle specific I/O error
    raise FileReadError(path, "File not found")
except EncryptionError:
    # Re-raise EncryptionError without converting it
    raise
except Exception as e:
    # Convert other errors to FileReadError
    raise FileReadError(path, str(e))
```

### Best Practices

1. **Be explicit in docstrings**: Clearly document all exceptions that can be raised by a method.

2. **Handle exceptions specifically**: Catch and handle specific exception types rather than using broad except clauses.

3. **Preserve exception types**: When you want tests to be able to catch specific errors, make sure those error types are preserved in your implementation.

4. **Test for specific exceptions**: Write tests that specifically check for the right exception types to catch issues early.
```

This explanation provides guidance for anyone running into similar issues with exception handling in tests.
